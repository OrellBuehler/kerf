# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What Kerf is

A cross-platform desktop app for AI-assisted, **non-destructive** video/audio editing.
A Cargo workspace of three Rust crates + a Tauri-embedded SvelteKit frontend. The
distinguishing feature: a **stdio MCP server** lets an LLM analyze media and assemble
edits through the same engine the GUI uses. Nothing is re-encoded until export.

## The `ffmpeg` feature — read this first

`ffmpeg-next` links the system FFmpeg dev libraries, which are **not always installed**.
Every crate has a default-on `ffmpeg` feature that forwards to `kerf-core/ffmpeg`.
In the workspace `Cargo.toml`, `kerf-core` is declared with `default-features = false`,
so the feature is **only** activated through these forwards — which is what makes
`--no-default-features` actually disable it everywhere.

**The engine has two backends** (`crates/kerf-core/src/engine/`):

- `cli.rs` is **always compiled** and drives the `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` **binaries**
  (override with `KERF_FFMPEG` / `KERF_FFPROBE`). Probe, `silencedetect`, scene
  detection, preview frames (`frame_at`; `frame_jpeg` for a low-res JPEG), the
  per-asset **contact sheet** (`contact_sheet` — a `tile`d grid of frames sampled
  across a range, for skimming footage) and the **composited timeline still**
  (`timeline_frame` / `build_timeline_frame_args`, pure + unit-tested — overlays
  every clip visible at a timeline time onto a black canvas, mirroring the export
  geometry, so an agent can *see the cut*), waveforms, and export all live here, so
  they work in the `--no-default-features` build — only the binaries are needed,
  never the dev libraries. Preview decodes go through a **cached all-intra proxy**
  (`generate_proxy` in the background, `ready_proxy` never blocks, resolved by
  `Project::preview_source`; export always reads the original): `proxy_width`
  gives 1280 normally but 3072 for a spherical asset, because reframing crops
  ~100° out of the sphere and would otherwise leave ~355 real pixels. That width
  is part of the cache key, so marking an asset 360 rebuilds its proxy.
  **GPU acceleration**: `hw_encoders()` probes once per process which hardware
  encoders (NVENC / QSV / VideoToolbox / AMF) this ffmpeg can *actually* use —
  each compiled-in candidate is verified with a one-frame test encode, because
  `-encoders` listing alone is not proof (`KERF_HW_ENCODE=none` disables). The
  list is surfaced as the `hw_encoders` Tauri command and the
  `export_capabilities` MCP tool, and the export dialog merges the verified ones
  into its codec choices. Proxy generation uses the first verified h264 HW
  encoder and stitching the first hevc one (both fall back to libx264 on any
  failure, and one such failure disables HW encode for the process). Background
  decodes (proxy, stitch, scene detection, the composited still) use the same
  `-hwaccel` (default `auto`, `KERF_HWACCEL=none` to disable) with a learned
  software fallback shared with the preview path; the GUI defaults export
  `hwaccel` to `auto` too, and `render_with_progress` retries a failed
  hardware-decode export once in software so the default can never lose a render.
  Export is a **positional, multi-track** `filter_complex`
  (`build_export_args` / `build_filter_complex`, both pure + unit-tested): a black
  canvas with every video clip `overlay`'d at its `timeline_start` (later tracks on
  top, gaps fall through to black) and every audio-bearing clip `adelay`'d to its
  position and summed with `amix` — so clip positions, gaps and track layering all
  render. `ExportOptions.fit` decides what happens when the delivery aspect differs
  from the footage: `Contain` (the default, and the historical behaviour) scales to
  fit and pads, `Cover` scales with `force_original_aspect_ratio=increase` and crops
  — which is what makes the vertical / square presets produce a usable shot rather
  than a strip of picture in a black field. It sets the *base* fit only; a clip with
  its own transform still composes on top.
  Tracks flagged `Track.duck` are mixed into their own bus and
  `sidechaincompress`'d against the rest before the final sum (music dips under
  dialogue); `ExportOptions.loudnorm` appends a single-pass `loudnorm` to -14 LUFS
  on the final mix, and `ExportOptions.range` renders only a span by building the
  graph from `Timeline::slice(start, end)` (a shifted sub-timeline copy — boundary
  clips retrimmed honoring speed/reverse, keyframes resampled, overlays clipped).
  The per-clip chains (`video_clip_chain` / `audio_clip_chain`) also realize
  each clip's **video effects** (`gblur`/`unsharp`/`hue`/`negate`/`vignette`, and
  `chromakey` which keeps alpha so a lower track shows through), **audio effects**
  (`highpass`/`lowpass`/`equalizer`/`acompressor`/`agate`) and **transform keyframes**
  — animated zoom via `scale=eval=frame`, animated position via the `overlay` x/y
  expr, rotation via `rotate`, opacity via `geq` (all driven by piecewise-linear
  `keyframe_expr` over clip-local time). **Text overlays** (`Timeline.overlays`) are
  `drawtext`'d onto the final composite (animated x/y/alpha exprs when keyframed); the
  still / preview path samples `Clip::transform_at` and draws overlays statically.
  **360 footage** is reprojected by `v360`: `StreamInfo.projection` is detected at
  probe time (`detect_projection` — a `Spherical Mapping` side-data entry, or an
  Insta360 `.insv` whose frame is two squares side by side; deliberately *no*
  bare-aspect guess) or set by hand with `set_asset_projection` (a persisted
  per-**asset** override for footage neither signal catches — a stitched equirect
  that lost its metadata; it sticks so every later cut reframes), and clips cut
  from such an asset get a default
  `Clip.reframe` (`Clip::for_asset`) aiming a virtual camera at the sphere. In
  `video_clip_chain` a reframed clip runs `setpts → fps → [sendcmd] → v360@c{n} →
  [crop]` *before* the fit `scale`: `fps` is hoisted so an 8K source reprojects at
  the output rate, `v360`'s `w`/`h` render straight to the export frame, and
  `crop` moves after reprojection (edge fractions of a raw fisheye frame are
  meaningless). Animation goes through `sendcmd` because `v360`'s yaw/pitch/roll/
  `d_fov` are command-settable — but each command rebuilds its remap LUT (~32 ms
  at 1080p), so `reframe_commands` emits only channels that actually move, gates
  on `REFRAME_CMD_TOLERANCE`, and leads each command by half a frame. Values are
  wrapped/clamped first: `v360` **silently discards** an out-of-range command.
  `fov` maps to `d_fov` (aspect-correct on its own; `h_fov` would stretch). The
  resulting graph outgrows argv — Linux caps one argument at 128 KiB, Windows the
  whole command line at 32767 — so `externalize_filter_complex` spills anything
  over `GRAPH_ARG_MAX` to a temp file passed via `-filter_complex_script`. The
  still path samples `Clip::reframe_at` to a constant `v360` instead, and
  `export_format` ignores a reframed clip's source dimensions so a 5760x2880
  capture does not become the deliverable size.
  A real **Insta360 capture is a *pair* of files** (`VID_…_00_….mp4` /
  `…_10_….mp4`), one circular fisheye per lens — neither is 360 on its own, so
  `Project::probe_import` stitches them at import: `insta360_pair` recognizes a
  square frame whose positional `_00_`/`_10_` lens token has a sibling on disk,
  `stitch_insta360` runs `hstack → v360=dfisheye:e:…:roll=180` (the lenses record
  upside down) into a 5760x2880 file cached at
  `<cache>/kerf/stitched/<hash>.mp4` keyed by *both* lens files (HEVC via a
  verified GPU encoder when one exists — the frame is too wide for h264 NVENC —
  else libx264 CRF 15), and the asset
  that lands describes **that** file (projection forced to `Equirect` — the CLI
  can't write an `sv3d` box) with the originals kept in `Asset.source_paths`.
  It is a full re-encode (~2x realtime in software, far faster on a GPU), so it
  streams progress (`import-progress`
  in the app), is serialized per pair, and dedupes via `insert_or_get_asset` —
  importing the other lens afterwards is a cache hit resolving to the same asset.
  Each input gets a **per-input `-ss` fast-seek** to its clip's source-window
  start (shared `clip_source_window`/`clip_seek`, frame-accurate against the
  seek-relative `trim`), so a cut from deep in a long source decodes only the kept
  region, not everything from `t=0`. **Still images** (PNG/JPEG/… — detected at
  probe time via `is_still_codec` + no audio + sub-second duration, flagged on the
  stream as `StreamInfo.image` and given `DEFAULT_IMAGE_DURATION` on import) are the
  exception: a still has no source timeline, so its input is `-loop 1 -framerate
  fps -t <window>` instead of `-ss`'d, and its in-graph `trim` stays absolute (seek
  forced to 0); `frame_*`/`timeline_frame` likewise decode the single frame without
  seeking. `render_with_progress` streams ffmpeg's `-progress` to report
  `{fraction, elapsed_secs, eta_secs}` and polls a cancel callback (killing ffmpeg →
  `RenderStatus::Cancelled`); `render_with` is the no-op-callback wrapper.
  `audio_pcm` decodes a source window to raw mono s16le PCM (input-side `-ss`) —
  the GUI's Web Audio preview playback fetches clip audio through it.
  **Playback is a real video stream**, not a slideshow: `stream_preview` hands a
  whole span to **one long-lived ffmpeg** (a spawn-seek-decode-exit cycle per frame
  caps well below frame rate however fast the machine is) and reads composited
  JPEGs off its stdout, split on the `FFD8`/`FFD9` markers. It composites through
  **the same graph the export builds** — `push_inputs` + `build_filter_complex`
  over a `Timeline::slice` from the playhead, both now shared with
  `build_export_args` — so what plays is what renders: every track, effect,
  keyframe and overlay, and the same `Timeline::for_render` gate, so a muted or
  solo-shadowed track is as absent from playback as from the file. Only the ends
  differ: proxy paths in (the caller passes
  `timeline_frame_inputs`' proxy-swapped assets), `-c:v mjpeg -f image2pipe pipe:1`
  out. Frames are **paced to the requested fps against the wall clock**, which
  throttles ffmpeg through pipe backpressure instead of letting it race ahead and
  buffer the whole timeline, and each carries its timeline time so the webview can
  drop one the audio clock has already passed.
- `ffmpeg.rs` is the in-process **libav** backend (the `ffmpeg` feature): it supplies
  `probe` and, behind the extra `libav-render` feature, an **experimental** in-process
  export pipeline. It can only compile with the dev libraries present (written against
  the ffmpeg-next 8.1 API). The default export path is the CLI one even in full builds.

**Transcription works in every build** (`engine/whisper.rs`, always compiled). Two
backends, picked by `analysis::default_transcriber`: the `whisper` feature's
in-process `whisper-rs` when it is compiled in, otherwise **FFmpeg 8.0's native
`whisper` audio filter** driven through the binary — `filter_available()` probes
`ffmpeg -h filter=whisper` once per process, `transcribe` runs
`aresample=16000,aformat=…,whisper=model=…:destination=…:format=srt` and parses the
SRT back (its `format=json` writes unescaped text, so SRT is the safe wire format).
`queue=30` overrides the filter's 3 s default, which would otherwise transcribe
three-second windows with no context. The model path is **never** put in the filter
graph (`:` and `\` are graph syntax, and a Windows path is both): ffmpeg runs with its
working directory set to the model's folder and both `model=` and `destination=` are
bare file names. Either backend gets its ggml model from `ensure_model`, which
**downloads it on first use** into `<cache>/kerf/models/ggml-<name>.bin` (streamed with
progress, `.part` + atomic rename, resumed via a range request, magic-byte checked so an
error page is never mistaken for a model). Which model: `set_speech_model` (the GUI
picker, persisted in project meta under `speech_model`) → `KERF_WHISPER_MODEL` (still
accepts a *path*, for existing setups) → `base`. `KERF_WHISPER_LANGUAGE` sets the
language hint, `KERF_WHISPER_MODEL_URL` an offline model mirror. `transcription_status()`
reports which backend is live, the model, and whether it still has to be fetched — the
transcript tab and an agent both read it to explain an empty transcript.
`analyze_asset_media_with_progress` streams a per-step `AnalysisProgress`
(`silence`/`scenes`/`loudness`/`rhythm`/`download_model`/`transcribe`/`done`), and
transcription runs **last** so the markers land before minutes of inference.

Two more optional features: `libav-render` (above) and `whisper` (in-process
`whisper-rs`; needs cmake, a C++ compiler and **libclang** at build time — turn it on
for release builds so transcription doesn't depend on how the user's ffmpeg was
configured). Both are off by default and **not** exercised by `--no-default-features` CI.

- **With FFmpeg dev libs** (full build): `cargo build` / `cargo run -p kerf-app`.
- **Without them** (CI, UI work): pass `--no-default-features`; everything but the
  in-process libav probe still works via the binaries.

## Common commands

```bash
# Rust — verify / test without FFmpeg dev libs (works everywhere)
cargo check --workspace --no-default-features
cargo test  -p kerf-core --no-default-features
cargo test  -p kerf-core --no-default-features split_and_remove_roundtrip   # single test

# The default run is pure (no binaries, no network). Tests that drive the real
# `ffmpeg` binary — playback streaming, the vertical/cover export — or download a
# real speech model are `#[ignore]`d, so run them explicitly when touching the
# engine or the export graph:
cargo test -p kerf-core --no-default-features -- --ignored

# MCP server — the desktop app hosts it (streamable HTTP on 127.0.0.1:7777/mcp).
# Run the app (below), then point an MCP client at the URL, e.g.:
#   claude mcp add --transport http kerf http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp
# Override the bind address with KERF_MCP_ADDR. There is no standalone MCP binary.

# Frontend (Bun) — from frontend/
bun install
bun run dev      # http://localhost:1420, fixed port; uses sample data outside Tauri
bun run build    # static SPA -> frontend/build (consumed by Tauri)
bun run check    # svelte-check (type check)
bun run test     # bun's built-in runner over src/**/*.test.ts

# Desktop app — Tauri config is NOT at the default path, pass --config
bunx @tauri-apps/cli@2 dev   --config crates/kerf-app/tauri.conf.json
bunx @tauri-apps/cli@2 build --config crates/kerf-app/tauri.conf.json
cargo run -p kerf-app        # also works; runs the frontend dev command first
```

There is no Rust lint config beyond defaults; `cargo clippy --workspace --no-default-features` is fine.

## Architecture

`kerf-core` is the UI-agnostic engine. **`kerf-app` is the only binary; it is a thin
adapter over the `Project` API and exposes that same API twice — as Tauri commands to
the webview and as MCP tools to a connected LLM, both over one shared `Project`.** Add
capabilities to `kerf-core` first, then expose them in each surface. Keep that boundary:
no editing logic in the adapter.

### kerf-core (`crates/kerf-core/src/`)

- `model.rs` — the domain types and the only place timeline math lives: `Asset`,
  `StreamInfo`, `Timeline`→`Track`→`Clip` (the EDL), `AssetAnalysis`. A `Clip`
  references a source range (`source_in`/`source_out`) of an asset at a
  `timeline_start` — non-destructive. Besides the geometry (`Transform`) / color
  (`Color`) / `Transition` fields, a clip carries a `Vec<VideoEffect>` and
  `Vec<AudioEffect>` (per-clip filter chains) and a `Vec<Keyframe>` (transform
  **animation** — `Clip::transform_at` interpolates it, the engine renders the
  motion). Text titles / lower-thirds / captions live on the timeline itself as
  `Timeline.overlays: Vec<TextOverlay>` (each with its own `TextKeyframe`
  animation); `transcript_to_srt` serializes a transcript to SubRip. A `Track`
  carries a `duck` flag (sidechain-ducked under the rest of the mix on export).
  Inherent helpers (`Timeline::locate`, `Track::end`/`reflow`, `Clip::duration`,
  `Timeline::slice` — the shifted sub-timeline copy behind range export) back the
  operations. **Beat alignment** lives here too and is pure + unit-tested:
  `Timeline::beat_grid` maps the audio tracks' cached `Tempo` onto timeline time
  (confidence-gated by `BEAT_MIN_CONFIDENCE`, mirroring the ruler's ticks) and
  `Track::align_cuts_to_beats` ripples a track's cuts onto that grid — each clip
  retrimmed at its **outgoing** edge (`source_in` for a reversed clip, whose tail
  is the source's head), gaps preserved and their incoming cuts snapped too,
  stretching only as far as the asset has footage (a still loops, so it is
  unbounded).
- `project.rs` — `Project` wraps a `rusqlite::Connection`. **Persistence shape:**
  `assets` and `analysis` are real tables (streams/analysis stored as JSON columns);
  the **entire timeline is a single JSON blob** in a one-row `timeline` table. All
  edits go through `edit_timeline(|tl| ...)` which loads → mutates → saves the blob.
  `Project::sample()` seeds an in-memory demo (two assets + analysis + a starter
  timeline + a sample task queue); it backs the kerf-core tests, but the app now
  launches with an **empty** `Project::open_in_memory()` — the user imports media or
  opens a `.kerf` file to populate it.
  `analyze_asset`, `frame_at` and `waveform` delegate to the engine; editing ops are
  unchanged. `snap_to_beats(track_id, tolerance)` is "cut to the beat": it collects
  every asset's cached `Tempo`, builds the grid and aligns one track (or every
  unlocked video track) to it, defaulting the tolerance to half a beat so each cut
  moves to the beat it is already nearest; it errors when nothing rhythmic has been
  analyzed rather than silently doing nothing. The **agent task queue** is a real `tasks` table (one row per `Task`,
  columns not JSON): `add_task` / `list_tasks` / `claim_next_task` / `complete_task`
  / `fail_task` / `resolve_task` / `remove_task` drive the `queued → working →
  ready → done` (or `failed`) lifecycle in `model.rs`.
- `analysis.rs` — transcription / scene / silence / rhythm are **pluggable traits**
  (`Transcriber`, `SceneDetector`, `SilenceDetector`, `RhythmAnalyzer`). Real impls
  now exist:
  `FfmpegSilenceDetector` / `FfmpegSceneDetector` (CLI engine, always available —
  scene detection decodes hardware-accelerated and scores at 640px, the metric
  being resolution-normalized), `FfmpegRhythmAnalyzer` (onsets + tempo +
  speech/music class from **one** PCM decode — they used to be three traits, each
  re-decoding the whole file), `WhisperFilterTranscriber` (the ffmpeg `whisper`
  filter, always compiled) and
  `WhisperTranscriber` (in-process, `whisper` feature); `NullAnalyzer` is still the
  fallback. `Transcriber::transcribe` takes a `ProgressFn` — alone among the
  providers, because it can download a model and then run for minutes.
  `Project::analyze_asset` wires them and caches the `AssetAnalysis`.
- `error.rs` — `Error`/`Result`; the `Ffmpeg(#[from] ffmpeg_next::Error)` variant is
  itself `#[cfg(feature = "ffmpeg")]`.

### embedded MCP server (`crates/kerf-app/src/mcp.rs`)

The app **is** the MCP server — there is no separate binary. `mcp::serve` hosts the
tools over `rmcp` 1.7's **streamable-HTTP** transport (`StreamableHttpService` +
`LocalSessionManager`, nested into an `axum` router) on `127.0.0.1:7777/mcp`
(`KERF_MCP_ADDR` overrides). It is spawned from `lib.rs`'s Tauri `.setup` hook on
`tauri::async_runtime` and shares the **same** `Arc<Mutex<Project>>` the Tauri commands
hold, so the agent edits the project the user has open. Patterns that matter if you edit
it: `#[tool_router]` on the impl + `#[tool_handler]` on `impl ServerHandler` — **no
`tool_router` field on the struct** (the macro calls `Self::tool_router()`).
`ServerInfo` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so `get_info` builds it via `Default::default()`
then mutates fields. Most tools return `Result<String, McpError>` (pretty JSON), but the
three **visual** tools — `get_frame` (a single drill-in frame), `skim_asset` (a
contact-sheet montage of an asset + a text index of cell→timestamp, for finding good
parts) and `preview_timeline` (the composited cut at a timeline time) — return
`Result<CallToolResult, McpError>` built by the `image_result` helper: a caption
`Content::text` plus a `Content::image(bare_base64, "image/jpeg")` block the LLM can
actually *see* (rmcp wants bare base64 + MIME, **not** a `data:` URL). The `lock()`
helper sets `EditSource::Agent` per-op under the shared lock (the GUI's `project()`
helper sets `User` the same way); every **mutating** tool calls `self.changed()`, which
emits a `project-changed` Tauri event so the webview re-fetches and the edit shows up
live in the GUI.

### kerf-app (`crates/kerf-app/src/lib.rs`, `main.rs`)

Tauri v2 shell. `lib.rs::run()` is the entry (`main.rs` just calls it); it owns the
`Arc<Mutex<Project>>` (cloned into both the Tauri managed state and `mcp::serve`) and
registers a command per `Project` op — reads (`list_assets`,
`get_timeline`, `get_asset_metadata`), `import_asset` / `analyze_asset` (emits
`analysis-progress` per step), speech-to-text (`transcription_status`,
`set_speech_model`, `download_speech_model` → emits `model-progress`), every editing
op (`cut_clip`, `add_clip`, `split_clip`, `trim_clip` (optional `timeline_start` so a
left-edge trim keeps the right edge put, atomically), `reorder_clip`, `move_clip`,
`ripple_delete`, `cut_clip_range` (remove a **source-time** span from a clip and
ripple closed — the transcript-editing primitive), `add_track`, `remove_track`,
`set_track_duck`, `remove_clip`, `set_volume`, `set_fade`,
`set_speed`, `set_transform`, `set_color`, `set_transition`, `set_video_effects`,
`set_audio_effects`, `set_keyframes` / `add_keyframe` / `clear_keyframes`,
`set_reframe` / `clear_reframe` / `set_reframe_keyframes` / `add_reframe_keyframe`,
`set_asset_projection` (asset-level 360 mark; returns the `Asset`),
`add_overlay` / `update_overlay` / `remove_overlay` / `set_overlay_keyframes`,
`captions_from_transcript`, `export_srt`, `remove_silence`, `snap_to_beats`,
`extract_audio`, `concatenate` — each returns the
refreshed `Timeline`), media (`get_frame` → base64 PNG data URL, `get_waveform`,
`start_playback` / `stop_playback` — streamed composited frames over a
`tauri::ipc::Channel`, cancelled **by caller-supplied id** rather than a generation
counter, because start and stop are separate async calls that can arrive out of
order and a late stop must not kill the stream that replaced it —
`get_audio` → a clip window as **raw mono s16le PCM via `tauri::ipc::Response`**, the
only non-JSON command — the preview's Web Audio playback decodes it), the
agent task queue (`list_tasks`, `add_task` → the new `Task`; `resolve_task` /
`remove_task` → the refreshed `Task[]`), and `export_timeline` (emits `export-progress`
events) / `cancel_export`. **No command runs on the main thread** (a plain sync
command would freeze the window in Tauri v2): quick ops are
`#[tauri::command(async)]`, and every heavy one (ffmpeg decode / analysis /
export, disk-bound open/save) is an `async fn` that pushes its work onto the
blocking pool via the `blocking()` helper — resolving inputs under the shared
project lock and **releasing it before the slow part** (see `lock_user`; the
lock-free `Project::decode_*` statics exist for exactly this). The MCP server's
heavy tools (`analyze_asset`, `get_frame`, `skim_asset`, `preview_timeline`,
`get_waveform`/`get_energy`, `export`) follow the same shape with `lock_agent`.
Tauri auto-converts JS camelCase args to Rust
snake_case (`{ assetId }` → `asset_id`). Config: `tauri.conf.json` points
`frontendDist` at `../../frontend/build` (resolved relative to the config file). The
`beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand` hooks, however, run from Tauri's *app dir* —
which for this `crates/kerf-app` layout resolves to `crates/`, not the config dir or repo
root — so they anchor to the repo via `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/frontend" && bun run dev`
instead of a fragile relative path.
`capabilities/default.json` grants `core:default` + `dialog:default` +
`updater:default` + `process:allow-restart` + `opener:allow-open-url`.

**Auto-update.** The app updates itself from its own GitHub releases via
`tauri-plugin-updater` (+ `tauri-plugin-process` for the relaunch), both
registered in `run()`. `plugins.updater` in `tauri.conf.json` points at
`https://github.com/OrellBuehler/kerf/releases/latest/download/latest.json`
and embeds the **minisign public key**: a bundle only installs if its signature
verifies against that key, so the update path is not just "trust whatever the
URL serves". `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` makes `tauri build` emit the
updatable bundles (`.app.tar.gz` / `.AppImage` / NSIS `-setup.exe`) plus a
`.sig` per bundle — which means **a bundle build now needs the private key**
(`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, or `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, plus
`…_PASSWORD`) in the environment; plain `cargo build` / CI is unaffected.
`release.yml` passes those from repo secrets, and a **separate
`updater-manifest` job** assembles `latest.json` from the uploaded `.sig` files
*after* all bundles land (`includeUpdaterJson: false` on the build step): the
per-platform jobs run concurrently and each writing the manifest would leave
only whichever finished last. Prereleases are skipped, so they never become the
update everyone is offered. In-place update is per-platform: macOS and Windows
(NSIS, `installMode: passive`) always; on Linux **only the AppImage** — a
`.deb`/`.rpm` install fails the install step, which the dialog reports with a
link to the release page.

### frontend (`frontend/`)

SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5 **runes** (forced on in `vite.config.ts`). Two layout quirks:
- **No `svelte.config.js`** — adapter and compiler options live inline in
  `vite.config.ts` via the `sveltekit()` plugin (new-style config). Static SPA via
  `adapter-static` (fallback `index.html`); `+layout.ts` sets `ssr = false` +
  `prerender = true`. Dev port is pinned to **1420** for Tauri.
- **Tailwind 4 = CSS config**, no `tailwind.config.js`. `src/routes/layout.css` imports
  the **Kerf design tokens** (`src/lib/styles/kerf-tokens.css`) and maps the shadcn
  semantic vars onto them; the app is **dark-only** (`<html class="dark">` in `app.html`).
  That file is also the `tailwind.css` in `components.json`. Run
  `bunx shadcn-svelte add <name>` to add primitives.

The editor UI is implemented from the **Kerf design system** (claude.ai/design): a dark,
editor-grade workspace under `src/lib/components/editor/` — bespoke atoms (`Btn`,
`IconBtn`, `Badge`, `Icon`, `KerfMark`) plus `TitleBar`, `Toolbar`, `MediaBin`,
`Preview`, `Timeline`, `Inspector`, `AgentPanel`, `StatusBar`, composed by
`routes/+page.svelte`. The `Inspector` (right panel) edits the selected clip —
trim, volume, fades, speed, transform, color, transition, plus **video / audio
effect chains** (add / tune / remove), **keyframe animation** (the Transform panel
auto-keyframes at the playhead and shows the sampled pose), a **360 reframe**
section (yaw / pitch / roll / FOV, auto-keyframing
at the playhead like Transform — note its `lerpAngle` takes the shortest arc, which
plain `lerp` would read as a 340° swing across the seam; for a source Kerf did not
detect as 360 it instead offers a projection picker that marks the whole asset via
`set_asset_projection`), and an always-visible
**Text overlays** section (add titles / lower-thirds, generate captions, edit
text / timing / position / size / color / box / bold).
**Polish presets** (`src/lib/style-presets.ts`, pure data over the existing
surfaces): the Color section leads with one-click **looks** —
Punchy / Warm / Cool / Faded / B&W chips (the active one highlights; the sliders
show exactly what a chip applied) built on `Color.temperature`, a warm-cool
channel in -1..1 rendered as opposing `eq` per-channel gammas (`eq_filter` —
omitted at 0 so old graphs stay byte-identical; plain saturation/gamma can't
tint) — and the Text overlays section leads with **Title / Lower third /
Caption** style chips that create a styled overlay at the playhead with
fade-in/out opacity keyframes; the caption style matches what
`captions_from_transcript` generates, so manual and generated captions look
alike.
Everything is styled with the CSS-variable tokens directly (inline `style`), not Tailwind
utilities. The **timeline is a bespoke NLE timeline** that renders **real `editor.timeline`
state** (ruler + tracks + clips positioned by `timeline_start`/duration at `ui.zoom`
px/sec + playhead), with scene markers / silence regions / **beat ticks** (the tempo grid
of audio-track clips, confidence-gated, hidden when beats land closer than 4px — from
`src/lib/beats.ts`, the TS mirror of the Rust beat math that the ruler, the drag
snapping and the browser harness's alignment all share, unit-tested with `bun test`)
mapped from `AssetAnalysis` and
real audio waveforms (`get_waveform`); the razor tool splits, Delete removes, Shift+Delete
ripple-deletes, clicks select/seek, and (pointer tool) **clips drag to reposition** — free
positioning with gaps, snapping to clip edges / playhead / 0 / beats, and **dropping onto another
same-kind track** (`move_clip`, via pointer events + `data-lane` hit-testing) — and
**edge-drag to trim** (6px `ew-resize` handles; clamped to source handles, neighbors and
a 0.05s minimum; left edges commit `trim_clip` with `timeline_start` so the right edge
stays put; stills extend freely since they loop). The ruler renders **in/out marks**
(`I`/`O` set at the playhead, `⇧I`/`⇧O` clear) that drive range export. Transport is
**J/K/L shuttle** (repeat taps double to ±8×) plus Space; playback is **audible**:
`src/lib/audio.ts` is a Web Audio engine that fetches clip PCM windows over `get_audio`
and schedules them with volume / fades / speed / reverse applied. **Per-clip effect
chains are auralized**: passing `clipId` to `get_audio` decodes the window through that
clip's own ffmpeg chain (`audio_effects_filter`, the same string the export renders), so
the chain is part of the buffer cache key and retuning an EQ re-fetches. It runs before
this engine's gain envelope where the export runs it after the clip gain — audible only
to a level-dependent effect, and keeping volume in Web Audio is what lets the fader stay
live instead of re-fetching PCM on every drag. Reverse shuttle is still silent. The
playhead follows the audio clock — edits mid-playback re-anchor via
`ui.resync()` from a `+page.svelte` effect. The timeline
toolbar's `+ V` / `+ A` add tracks and each track header has a `×` to remove one
(`add_track` / `remove_track`) and, on audio tracks, a **DUCK toggle**
(`set_track_duck`); the timeline is genuinely **multi-track**. The old
`@xyflow/svelte` `TimelineCanvas`/`clip-node` scaffold was removed (the
dep is still in `package.json`, now unused). `Preview` shows the composited frame under the playhead, and during
**forward 1× playback it switches to the streamed frame source** (`start_playback`)
— per-frame `get_timeline_frame` decodes stay for scrubbing, shuttle and the
settled frame, where you want *one* frame rather than all of them. Its effect keys
off `ui.seekEpoch` (bumped only by a deliberate seek or a fresh play) and never off
`ui.time`, which ticks every animation frame and would respawn ffmpeg 60×/sec.
Which frames survive is `playback-sync.ts`'s `createFrameGate` (`show`/`skip`/
`resync`, unit-tested — the one piece of frontend logic with tests): every frame
arrives late by a *constant* transport cost (ffmpeg's spawn, then base64 + JSON +
IPC) that on its own exceeds the two-frame `STALE_AFTER` budget, so lag is judged
against the smallest this stream has managed rather than against zero — measuring
from zero dropped every frame forever and froze the pane. Only growth past that
floor is drift: `STALE_AFTER` skips the frame, `RESYNC_AFTER` restarts the stream
from the playhead rather than playing it out in slow motion against the sound.
`start_playback` logs `frames` / `first_frame_ms` per run, which is what separates
"never started" from "sent but dropped"; in the browser harness `startPlayback`
**synthesizes** frames at the requested fps behind a deliberate 90 ms lag, so
playback moves under `bun run dev` and that failure mode is reproducible without a
desktop build. `ExportDialog` (⌘E) drives
the full `ExportOptions` surface — presets, containers/codecs, rate control, resolution,
loudness normalize, and a **Range: In → out** choice when marks are set. `MediaBin`'s
**Transcript tab is an editing surface**: lines resolve to the clip carrying them,
click seeks, the playhead line highlights, and `×` cuts the sentence from the timeline
(`cut_clip_range`); cut lines render struck through. When it is *empty* it says which
of the five reasons applies (nothing selected / no backend / model not downloaded /
not analyzed / no speech) and offers the matching action — a model picker + download,
or Analyze — instead of a dead end. The **agent panel is a real MCP task
queue** (status · queue · history · add-task) — Kerf has no in-app chat; a connected
LLM claims tasks over MCP. The queue is `agent` state (`src/lib/agent.svelte.ts`, a third
runes singleton) backed by the `tasks` table over Tauri/MCP: the add-task box and preset chips
`agent.add(...)` real tasks, and `ready` tasks show Apply/Dismiss (`resolve_task`/`remove_task`).
Three preset chips (`Remove silences` / `Assemble rough cut` / `Cut to the beat` — which
analyzes whatever is on the audio tracks first, then calls `snap_to_beats`, and says
"No cuts were near a beat" instead of claiming an alignment when the grid never reached
them) also run the matching local op and
resolve their task; the rest just enqueue for the agent. In the browser there is no agent, so
queued tasks correctly just wait. Below the queue, the **History** section renders
`editor.history` (the `Revision[]` edit log, attributed to user/agent/system) with one-click
`editor.revertTo(seq)`.

The **update flow** is its own runes singleton (`src/lib/updater.svelte.ts`,
alongside `editor`/`ui`/`agent`): it runs a *silent* check at startup and every
6 h through `api.ts`'s `checkUpdate` / `installUpdate` / `relaunchApp`, and drives
`idle → checking → { current | available → downloading → ready } | error`. The
title bar's version chip turns into an amber "⬇ 0.18.0" button when something is
available and opens `UpdateDialog` (release notes, download progress, then
**Restart now** — which warns first when the project has unsaved changes); the
dialog auto-opens the first time a given version is seen (remembered under
`kerf.update.seen` in localStorage) so declining doesn't nag every launch. The
`Update` handle the plugin returns stays module-local in `api.ts`, which hands the
UI plain data — so the browser harness can fake the whole flow: `bun run dev`
with **`?update=1`** offers a synthetic 0.99.0 and simulates the download, making
the dialog explorable without a signed desktop build.
`data.ts` keeps only the `STATUS_MAP`/`PRESETS` presentation bits —
all project data renders from the real backend.

`src/lib/api.ts` is the backend bridge: `inTauri()` decides between `invoke(...)` and a
**seeded in-memory sample with working local timeline ops**, so every edit/analysis/waveform
is explorable in a plain browser via `bun run dev` (frames return `null` there → Preview
keeps its placeholder). This browser sample is a **dev harness only** — the desktop app always
uses the real backend and starts empty. State is two runes singletons: `src/lib/state.svelte.ts`
(`export const editor` — assets, timeline, analyses, selection, and the editing actions that
call the backend and apply the returned `Timeline`) and `src/lib/editor-ui.svelte.ts`
(`export const ui` — chrome state, playhead/zoom/playback, and `runAnalysis` which runs real
analysis and toggles the `analyzing` flag). There is **no scripted demo phase machine**: the
editor chrome derives from real state — `MediaBin` shows a dropzone until `editor.assets` is
non-empty, `StatusBar` shows the selected asset's real fps/resolution/codec and timeline
duration, and `Preview` shows the decoded frame or a "No media loaded" placeholder.

- Keep types in sync across the boundary: `kerf-core` serde structs ↔ `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`.
  Field names are snake_case in the JSON on both Tauri and MCP.
- License is **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0** (public repo). New files inherit it via
  `license.workspace = true`; don't add other license headers.
- Versions were pinned against the crates.io sparse index / npm; check there (not the
  blocked crates.io JSON API) before bumping.
